# DefineHack

Define '22 was a 24-hour free offline hackathon from 5 to 6 Nov 2022, hosted by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology](https://mbcet.ac.in), Thiruvananthapuram, aimed to build solutions for the real world and go above and beyond the verticals.&#x20;



This case study is a journey of all the elements that came together to transpire what came in the 24 hours of Define. The planning, the brand, the verticals, teams, operations, sponsorship and finally the D-days
